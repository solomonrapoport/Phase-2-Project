Author: Solomon Rapoport

# Overview
This project analyzes real estate in King County, using data-driven solutions from a dataset of 30,155 homes to provide concrete business suggestions for a real estate agency in KC that helps homeowners buy and sell homes.

# Business Problem
Real estate agencies in King County, Washington, might be able to provide better suggestions to their clients, prospective home buyers/sellers, in regards to factors that might impact the price of a home, be those more obvious factors such as home location and size, or more subtle ones such as bathroom count or patio size.

# Data
The King County dataset is comprised of a list of over 30,000 homes in King County purchased between 2021 and 2022, and includes information on each home such as year built (some homes as early as 1900, some as recent as 2022), location, price paid, and various other specifications (number of floors, bedrooms, and bathrooms, square footage, year last renovated, etc.).

# Methods
This project uses linear regression and data visualizations find trends among variables as well as over time, in order to identify and provide recommendations and solutions to real estate agencies in King County.
# Results

# Conclusions
This analysis leads to three recommendations for improving the business of our real estate agency in Kansas City:

-**Stress to clients the strong correlation between waterfront properties and price**. One model that was run showed that a waterfront home is correlated with an increase of $1,145,000 in value versus a home that is not waterfront! Compared  with the mean of the average home price in the dataset, the price of a waterfront home is about 1.755 standard deviations higher. In a normally distributed dataset, that would align with the top 5% of home prices.
